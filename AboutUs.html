	<h1 class="clearPad">About Us</h1>
	<p>Our company started in June of 1999 as a small team of renovators.
	With our drive and dedication to quality, our company grew quick. Soon
	we were taking on larger projects and finished our first new construction
	project in 2005. Today we have over 150 experts, ready to tackle any part
	of the home building process.</p>
